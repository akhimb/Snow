# Snow
OWASP Snow is a software-based screen blurring technology.
Once activated, it will blur the entire screen so that everything on the screen will become illegible.
You can unblur a small portion of the screen by hovering your mouse cursor on items you want to see.
Its its Desktop version - proof of concept.
